# Session Summary: October 31, 2024

## 🔥 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Data Leakage Eliminated** ✅
**Problem:** We were indexing **training questions with answers** instead of Wikipedia articles.

**Impact:** Model had access to answers during "retrieval" - completely invalid evaluation!

**Solution:**
- Created `index_wikipedia_corpus.py` that loads actual Wikipedia articles
- Deleted leaky scripts (`train_fixed_rag.py`, `index_wikipedia_for_nq.py`)
- Now indexes clean Wikipedia text with NO answer information

### 2. **Memory Optimization** ✅
**Problem:** OOM errors when loading both retriever + LLM simultaneously.

**Solution:** Two-pass evaluation
- **Pass 1:** Load retriever → retrieve contexts → save → unload
- **Pass 2:** Load LLM → use cached contexts → generate

**Status:** Working perfectly! Retriever loads/unloads cleanly.

### 3. **NumPy Compatibility** ✅
**Problem:** NumPy 2.x incompatible with TensorFlow/Transformers.

**Solution:** Pinned `numpy<2.0.0` in `pyproject.toml`

## 🎯 New Makefile Commands

```bash
# Wikipedia Indexing (NO data leakage)
make index-wiki           # Full English Wikipedia (~6M articles)
make index-wiki-simple    # Simple Wikipedia (~200k articles)
make index-wiki-small     # Quick test (10k articles)

# RAG Evaluation (memory-efficient)
make run-fixed-rag        # Quick test (10 examples, 8-bit quant)
make run-fixed-rag-full   # Full eval (100 examples)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Document Corpus ≠ QA Dataset**
   - Need explicit separation
   - Prevents accidental data leakage

2. **Memory Management is Critical**
   - Can't assume both models fit
   - Need resource-aware pipelines

3. **Evaluation Should be Modular**
   - Separate stages: retrieve → generate → evaluate
   - Enable caching and partial re-runs

4. **Artifact Management Needs Structure**
   - Track provenance (which corpus, when, how)
   - Version control for reproducibility

### Proposed New Entities

See `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` for details:

1. **DocumentCorpus** - Clean document sources (NO answers)
2. **IndexBuilder** - Structured indexing workflow  
3. **ArtifactRegistry** - Versioning and provenance
4. **PipelineStages** - Modular evaluation components
5. **ResourceManager** - Automatic memory management

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Data leakage fixed
- Two-pass evaluation implemented
- Wikipedia indexing clean
- Memory management improved

### ⚠️ Needs More Work
- Still hitting OOM on some queries (context too long)
- No formal corpus abstraction yet
- Artifact management is ad-hoc
- Configuration scattered

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:**
   - Test with `top-k=3` and fragmentation fix
   - Verify full 10-example run completes

2. **Short-term (this week):**
   - Implement `DocumentCorpus` base class
   - Create `IndexBuilder` for clean workflow
   - Add `ArtifactRegistry` for tracking

3. **Medium-term (next week):**
   - Refactor to pipeline stages
   - Add resource manager
   - Implement caching system

4. **Long-term:**
   - Unified configuration (Hydra)
   - Experiment tracking (MLflow)
   - Full reproducibility

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Data leakage is subtle** - Need strong abstractions to prevent it
2. **Memory is precious** - Design for resource constraints from the start
3. **Modularity enables debugging** - Two-pass saved us from OOM hell
4. **Architecture matters** - Today's issues reveal missing abstractions

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

- Test the latest optimizations (`top-k=3`, fragmentation fix)

- Consider whether to keep backward compatibility or clean break
- Discuss dependency additions (Hydra? MLflow?)
